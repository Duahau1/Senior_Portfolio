                            <p class="card-text">In this project, I primarily worked on implementing an 3D interactive
                                globe that shows the COVID-19 cases worldwide and an interactive US map that shows the
                                COVID-19 cases nationwide. I hooked the search functionality of each of the map with the
                                serverless function I made which help reduce retrieval time by caching temporal data in
                                Redis Cache. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                Other than that, I wrote e2e tests for the applications using
                                Jest+Puppeteer and set up CI/CD pipeline under Github Actions. About me, I have a keen
                                interest in learning about designing software and writing blog. I hope that in the
                                future the pandemic is cleared out and I have more chances to work on interesting
                                projects like this.

                            <p class="card-text">I thought that Ultimate TicTacToe was not a widely known thing when I
                                recommended adding it to our Covid Tracker. It wasnt until we were trying to come up
                                with the rules that Payton mentioned she found it on Wikipedia and also that some
                                acquaintances had mentioned it in a message thread as well. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                But I digress... I worked on
                                the backend logic for the Ultimate TicTacToe game as well as played my part to help
                                others where I could be it by boosting moral with as many references I could, playing
                                devils advocate, garnering extra credit from Shane or letting Van use my heroku account.
                                I, at this moment, have a position as a Software Engineer at ClickBank and will
                                hopefully still be employed there after graduation. On an unrelated note: play D&D, go
                                Lakers, go Titans.

                                are a SaaS company that works to connect people with buildings by providing insights,
                                analytics, and data representation for a buildings HVAC system and other equipment. They
                                are located in Washington D.C., but I am currently working remotely as a Software
                                Engineer Intern for them and have accepted a full time offer starting in January 2021.
                                Ive worked with a variety of tools and languages but find I most enjoy languages like
                                Java and working on front end development. For this project, I worked on getting the
                                front end designed and implemented for the tic-tac-toe game with React and NodeJS. We
                                wanted to add a twist on the COVID-19 tracker that everyone was doing by adding
                                something that would provide a moment of stress relief when looking at the state of the
                                world during this pandemic.

                                API. I integrated built in functions to route weblinks and pages that were implemented
                                by my other teamates. I also used Styled. Components to assist with the CSS designs of
                                each page. I currently have an Internship with eTT Aviation as a Junior Software
                                Engineer where I do Full Stack Development for a SkedFlex Software used by Airlines.
                                After graduation, the plan is to be hired on full time where I will continue to help
                                develop thier software here in Boise, Idaho after January 2021. Languages I primarily
                                use are: Java, JavaScript, PHP, C# and Swift. I will aslo continue to help design
